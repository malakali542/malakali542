            <h2>Non Work Experiences</h2>
            <p>My greatest passion is bridging the gap between technological inequality and building products for social good. My goal is to create welcoming experiences that incite meaningful change and empower othersâœ¨. </p>
            <p>
            My current interests are education tech, accessibility, human-computer interaction, women in tech/product, the arts, and I'm always pondering about the ways I can leverage my background in engineering for social good.</p>
            <p>I've been a mentor at BridgeTOYouth empowering high school students at underserved communities. I've ran basketball camps for free for children in my community.</p>
