            <p>It's nice to e-meet you &#127804;. I wanted this to be a space where you can get to know me, actually get to know me. Not through a resume or through my linkedin profile.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm the most curious engineer you'll meet (bold statement I know). I see the world in systems and have solved complex problems that touch almost every engineering discipline. From improving product education for Uber's carpool offering, to building mechanical components for autonomous vehicles that detect sidewalk safety concerns.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Most of all, I want to make an impact and better the lives of others. From a young age, I took on odd jobs and tasks including tutoring kids in underserved communities, running free basketball summer camps, mentoring students in University and more. <b>I want to elevate others.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>I work in the intersection of product and engineering, understanding people, and finding and solving their actual problems is what excites me. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently in my 4th year at the University of Waterloo studying Systems Design Engineering (8 months to go...)</p>
            <!-- <p>Do you feel like you understand me a little bit better? Here's a fire round of some fun facts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm the oldest of 4 in a single parent 1st generation household, I think that set me up with crazy good adaptability skills, communication, and I've always been used to responsibility.</li>
                <li>I often write about my experiences and use writing as an outlet, find some snippets in "Not Work".</li>
                <li>I created Amazon's "Your Voice is Power" coding curiculuum to teach kids in underserved communities how to code!</li>
                <li>I moved across the planet last year and went to Madrid as an exchange student (I loved it!)</li>
                <li>I started a podcast on biotechnology where I speak to industry experts, learn more in "Not Work".</li>
                <li>I have an instagram account for my cat, I'm also a little bit allergic to her.</li>
            </ul> -->
